           There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The <span> U.S. Bureau of 
           Labor Statistics</span> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is more than four times the average </br> for all occupations. What’s more, the median annual pay for a 
           software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. 
           workers.
           </p> 
        
        <p>
           Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of 
           software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—and it’s often 
           beneficial to know multiple languages.Trying to break into the field of software programming 
           can be a daunting experience,especially for professionals with no prior programming 
           experience

           specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another 
           field of study.
